TWiT Mobile
===========

## My entry for the SproutCore hackathon.

I love TWiT, so I made an attempt to put together an iPhone app that would run inside a PhoneGap wrapper.

Most things work, but it is definitely not complete! Not enough time! :)

## Live Demo

Here's the app running on Strobe's beta platform. Add it to your home screen on your iOS device!

## Known Issues

* Audio and video support is incomplete, buggy, and lacks proper playback controls.
* The CSS used to form the iOS style controls (such as the back button) only work in the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, and Mobile Safari on iOS 5.

## Let me know what you think!
