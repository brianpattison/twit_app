TWiT Mobile
===========

### My entry for the SproutCore hackathon.

I love TWiT, so I made an attempt to put together an iPhone app that would run inside a PhoneGap wrapper.

Most things work, but it is definitely not complete! Not enough time! :)

### Live Demo

Here's the app running on Strobe's beta platform. Add it to your home screen on your iOS device!
